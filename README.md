# C++ Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my C++ Programming Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that I've developed, organized by different topics and assignments. Whether you're a student, educator, or fellow developer, I hope you find this repository helpful for learning or reference.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories, each containing C++ programs related to specific topics or assignments:

- **IO Object ASMT 29:** Input/Output programs focusing on object-oriented techniques.
- **Function Overloading ASMT 30:** Programs demonstrating function overloading in C++.
- **Function Overloading ASMT 31:** More programs demonstrating function overloading in C++.
- **Class & Object ASMT 32:** Understanding classes and objects.
- **Member Function & Static ASMT 33:** Programs exploring member functions and static members.
- **Constructor ASMT 34:** Exploring constructors in C++.
- **Operator Overloading ASMT 35:** Understanding operator overloading.
- **Friend Operator ASMT 36:** Implementing friend functions and friend classes.
- **Pointer, this & DMA ASMT 37:** Working with pointers, the `this` pointer, and dynamic memory allocation.
- **Inheritance ASMT 38:** Implementing various forms of inheritance in C++.
- **File Handling ASMT 39:** Programs focusing on file handling operations.

## Getting Started

To explore the programs:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-programming-portfolio.git
1. **Navigate to the Desired Directory**
   Each directory contains .c files with well-commented code. You can compile and run the programs using a C compiler like GCC.
   ```bash
   cd Class\ &\ Object\ ASMT\ 32
   g++ -o outputfile programfile.cpp./outputfile


## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a personal archive of my journey in learning C programming. Each folder corresponds to specific assignments or topics, and the code within is written to solve various programming challenges.
